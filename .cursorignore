# Cursor Indexing Control
# Controls what Cursor indexes for semantic search
# Note: This is a community pattern; behavior may vary by Cursor version

# ---- Force-include high-value docs (negation) ----
# These should always be indexed for context
!CLAUDE.md
!README.md
!docs/architecture/**
!docs/prompts/**
!spec/**
!.cursor/rules/**

# ---- Exclude low-value content ----
# Large generated files
docs/llms-full.txt
docs/llms/external/**

# Evidence snapshots (historical, not design docs)
docs/evidence/**

# Database dumps and backups
backups/**
*.dump
*.backup

# Generated inventory (regenerated on each run)
docs/inventory/repo_inventory.json
docs/inventory/feature_matrix.json

# Test fixtures and snapshots
**/__snapshots__/**
**/fixtures/**
**/testdata/**

# Vendor code (not our patterns)

**/third_party/**

# OCA cloned repos (external code)

# Large data files
