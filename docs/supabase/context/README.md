# Supabase Project Context Pack (DEPRECATED)

> **⚠️ LEGACY ARTIFACT**
> Do not refresh this directory. It has been replaced by the `meta` layer database introspection API (see `spec/schema-appreciation`).
>
> Kept for forensic comparisons and onboarding only. Do not build new agents or scripts that rely on reading these static SQL/JSON dumps, as they will drift from production.

## Previous Contents

This directory originally contained a deterministic, machine-readable + human-readable dump of the Supabase project configuration (schemas, functions, RLS, triggers, etc) generated by `scripts/db/generate_supabase_context_pack.sh`.
