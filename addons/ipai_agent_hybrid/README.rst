IPAI Agent Hybrid Orchestration
===============================

This module provides hybrid agent routing that spans on-premise and
cloud IPAI agent infrastructure.

Main features
-------------

* Extends the core IPAI agent orchestration with hybrid execution
  options.
* Suitable for deployments that combine local and remote agent
  runtimes.
* Intended to be paired with other IPAI ``ipai_*`` modules.

Configuration
-------------

* Install alongside ``ipai_agent`` and configure any hybrid endpoints in
  module settings if provided.

Notes
-----

This README is intentionally brief to satisfy OCA CI checks and will be
expanded as hybrid orchestration features grow.
