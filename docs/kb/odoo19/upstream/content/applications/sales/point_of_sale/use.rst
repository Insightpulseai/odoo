.. _pos/use/create-pos:

Create a POS
============

If no point of sale exists yet in the database, a set of POS cards is displayed on the Point of Sale
:guilabel:`Dashboard`. Each card represents a business type. Click a card to create a POS with
preconfigured settings tailored to that type. These settings can be adjusted later as needed.

To create additional POS or to create one from scratch, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale -->
Configuration --> Point of Sales` and click :guilabel:`New`. Then, configure the :ref:`POS settings
<pos/use/settings>` to meet your specific business requirements.

.. note::
   Click :guilabel:`Configurations > Settings` to access more settings.

.. important::
   Assign a dedicated :doc:`cash payment method <../point_of_sale/payment_methods>` and :ref:`cash
   journal <accounting/journals/cash>` to each POS. This ensures that accounting entries are
   separated and traceable to specific points of sale.

.. _pos/use/settings:

   the current order upon saving.

Send marketing messages
-----------------------

Customers' contact details, such as their phone number or email addresses, are stored
automatically when sending :doc:`receipts <use/receipts>` by email, SMS or Whatsapp. They can then
be used, for example, for :doc:`marketing <../../marketing>` purposes.

--> Orders --> Orders`, open a POS order form, navigate to the :guilabel:`Contact Info` category

To filter orders based on their status, click the :guilabel:`Active` dropdown menu and select one of
the following options:

- :guilabel:`Active`: Orders currently in progress. This includes orders marked as
  :guilabel:`Ongoing`, as well as those in the :guilabel:`Payment` or the :guilabel:`Receipt` stages
  (i.e., orders for which the receipt has been emailed to the customer).
- :guilabel:`Paid`: Paid orders.

To navigate between pages, click the :icon:`fa-caret-left` or :icon:`fa-caret-right`
(:guilabel:`caret`) icon.

To access an order in the register, click it, then click :guilabel:`Load Order`.

#. Click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) button, then :icon:`fa-undo`
   :guilabel:`Refund`.

      Access the list of orders and filter them by status to display only :guilabel:`Paid` orders.

#. Select the relevant order from the order list.
#. Select the items and use the keypad to set the refund quantity, then click :guilabel:`Refund`.

     :guilabel:`Validate`.
   - To issue a :ref:`gift card <ewallet_gift/gift-cards>` for the refund amount, click
     :guilabel:`Back`. A new order containing the returned items (with negative quantities) is
     created automatically. Then, add the gift card from the product list to the order; its value
     is set automatically to match the total refund amount. Click :guilabel:`Payment`, then
     :guilabel:`Validate` the refund.

.. note::
   - You cannot add other products to the cart until the refund has been validated.
   - Alternatively, refunds can be processed by:

      - Selecting the returned product(s) from the POS register and setting a negative quantity
        equal to the number of returned items. To do so, click :guilabel:`Qty` and :guilabel:`+/-`,
        and update the quantity accordingly.
      - Selecting the returned product(s) from the POS register and a :ref:`preset
        <pos/restaurant/orders/preset>` set up for the return mode.
      - Accessing the POS dashboard, navigating to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Orders -->
        Orders`, selecting an order, and clicking :guilabel:`Return Products`.

Once the return is validated, a corresponding credit note is generated, referencing the original
:doc:`receipt <use/receipts>` or :doc:`invoice <use/pos_invoices>`.

.. _pos/use/notes:

Notes
=====

Notes allow you to attach extra information to specific products in an order. There are two types of
notes: internal notes and customer notes.

Internal notes
--------------

Internal notes provide information meant for staff (e.g., `no tomato` for the kitchen). These notes
do not appear on the customer’s receipt. To add a note to an order, ensure no item is selected and
click :guilabel:`Note`. Likewise, to add a note to one specific item, select it from the cart and
click :guilabel:`Note`. Then, add or modify the note's content in the popup that opens:

     - Type the note directly into the window, or
     - Use a configured note model to save time if the same content is frequently used. Click on the
       desired note model to insert its text.

To create or edit note models, navigate to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration -->
Note Models`, click :guilabel:`New` or the relevant note model, then complete or edit the
:guilabel:`Name` column.

Customer notes
--------------

Notes for customers appear on :doc:`receipts <use/receipts>` and :doc:`invoices <use/pos_invoices>`.
They can be used, for example, to provide warranty details for a high-value item or specific care
instructions, such as `Dry clean only`.

To add a **customer note** from the :ref:`POS register <pos/use/open-register>` to a specific item,
select a product from the cart and click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`)
button. Click :guilabel:`Customer Note`, then add the note's content in the popup window.

.. note::
   - If no item is selected, the note applies for the whole order.
   - Product notes from an :doc:`imported SO <shop/sales_order>` are displayed identically in the
     cart.

.. _pos/use/cash-register:

Manage the cash register
========================

Odoo POS allows you to determine which coins and bills are accepted. To set up the allowed coins and
bills:

#. Navigate to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Coins/Bills`.
#. Click :guilabel:`New` to add a new value.
#. Select the POS where this value is available in the :guilabel:`Point of Sale` column or leave the
   field empty to make it available for all POS.

To record a cash in or cash out transaction not associated with a sale:

#. Click the :icon:`fa-bars` (:guilabel:`hamburger menu`) icon on the POS interface.
#. Click :guilabel:`Cash In/Out`.
#. In the popup that opens, select :guilabel:`Cash In` or :guilabel:`Cash Out`.
#. Enter the amount.
#. Specify the reason for the addition or removal of cash, and :guilabel:`Confirm`.

.. note::
   Only employees with :ref:`basic or advanced access rights <pos/employee_login/configuration>`
   are allowed to perform cash in/out actions.

.. _pos/use/register-close:

Close the POS register
======================

To close the POS register, click the :icon:`fa-bars` (:guilabel:`hamburger menu`) icon, then
:guilabel:`Close Register`.

In the :guilabel:`Closing Register` pop-up that opens, you can view:

- The number of orders and the total amount made during the session.
- The expected amounts grouped by payment method.

#. Click :icon:`fa-money` (:guilabel:`money`) to specify the number of each coin and bill.
#. Click :guilabel:`Confirm` to return to the previous pop-up window. The computed amount is set in
   the :guilabel:`Cash Count` field, and the :guilabel:`Closing Details` are specified in the
   :guilabel:`Closing Note` section.
#. Click :guilabel:`Close Register` to close the register and post accounting entries.

.. tip::
   Click :icon:`fa-clone` (:guilabel:`clone`) to automatically fill in the field with the expected
   cash amount.

.. note::
   - When the money counted does **not** match the expected amount, a :guilabel:`Payments
     Difference` window automatically pops up. Selecting :guilabel:`Proceed Anyway` validates the
     session and automatically posts the discrepancy to the designated cash difference journal.
   - Closing the register of a :doc:`restaurant <restaurant>` POS when orders are still in draft
     and not scheduled for later is not allowed and opens a pop-up window on which you can either
     :guilabel:`Review Orders` or :guilabel:`Cancel Orders`.
   - It is strongly advised to close the POS register at the end of each day.
