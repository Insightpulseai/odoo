Odoo Phone with Axivox
======================

`Axivox <https://www.axivox.com/>`__ is a |VOIP| provider that can be set up to work with Odoo
**Phone**. An Axivox account is required to use this service.

To use this service, `contact Axivox <https://www.axivox.com/en/contact>`_ to open an account.
Before doing so, verify that Axivox covers the company's area, along with the areas the company's
users wish to call.

.. important::
   Before setting up an account with Axivox, verify the following requirements:

   - The business phone numbers are portable to Axivox. Some providers may be unable to release the
     phone number due to local or regional guidelines.
   - The locations of the company and its call recipients are covered by Axivox services. Axivox
     services are based in Europe, so international call performance may vary.

Configuration
=============

To configure Axivox services in the Odoo database, first :ref:`install <general/install>` the
**Phone** app.
