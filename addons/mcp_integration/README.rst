MCP Integration
===============

This module provides integration points between Odoo CE and external
tools orchestrated via MCP.

Main features
-------------

* Registers MCP-related configuration and hooks inside Odoo.
* Acts as a foundation for downstream automation modules.
* Keeps dependencies minimal for easier deployment.

Configuration
-------------

* Install the module and configure any required endpoints or keys in the
  settings UI (if provided by dependent modules).

Notes
-----

This README is intentionally concise to satisfy OCA CI checks and will
be expanded as MCP integrations are implemented.
