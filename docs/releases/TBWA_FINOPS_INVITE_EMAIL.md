## What we'd like you to test

Please try to:

1. Open a sample **month-end period** (e.g. "2025-12 Close – Cluster A").
2. Walk through a couple of **checklist tasks**:
   - Review the task structure and owners
   - Update status on a few sample items
3. Open the **Finance dashboard**:
   - Check if the metrics and layout are intuitive
   - Confirm whether the views are useful for day-to-day close

Feel free to note anything that is:
- Confusing in the UI or navigation
- Missing from the close checklist
- Missing from the dashboard views
