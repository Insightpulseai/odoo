analysis:
  expensive_surfaces:
    - "Apps + Registry = $72 (equivalent to a medium droplet — dead weight once Vercel canonical)"
    - "Backups + Snapshots + Volumes = $56.48 (compounded silently; needs retention enforcement)"
  decision: >
    Commit to Vercel + droplet compose as canonical. DO App Platform = 0. Registry = 0.
    Use snapshot retention policy (policy.yaml). Volumes must have owner tag.
