The following external documentation surfaces were queried and analyzed to produce the GitHub Capabilities Deep Research:

1. **GitHub Documentation Root**: [https://docs.github.com/en](https://docs.github.com/en)
   - _Purpose_: Established high-level navigation, confirming primary developer vectors (CI/CD, APIs, Apps).
2. **GitHub REST API Docs**: [https://docs.github.com/en/rest](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
   - _Purpose_: Extracted REST endpoints for GitHub Actions, Copilot, Dependabot, Releases, Search, and Repositories.
3. **GitHub Apps Docs**: [https://docs.github.com/en/apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps)
   - _Purpose_: Analyzed the authentication models (webhooks, server-to-server tokens, "Login with GitHub"), validating Apps vs OAuth Apps limitations.
4. **GitHub Actions Docs**: [https://docs.github.com/en/actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
   - _Purpose_: Verified workflow syntax, continuous integration hooks, and the ability to combine Actions with REST APIs (`workflow_dispatch`).

_Note: All research was conducted via read-only headless scraping of the public docs.github.com domain._
