# Root Boundary Inventory — SSOT
# Classifies every top-level entry in the repo root.
#
# Statuses:
#   aligned           — canonical, belongs here per CLAUDE.md / PLATFORM_REPO_TREE
#   duplicate         — content duplicates another canonical path
#   misplaced         — README-only stub or wrong location
#   candidate_archive — transient / scratch / should not be at root
#   tooling           — IDE / build / agent tooling (dot-prefixed, expected)
#   unknown           — no clear owner or purpose; needs triage
