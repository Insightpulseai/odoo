# OCA Module Porting Queue for Odoo 19.0
# Auto-generated timestamp: 2026-02-20T18:00:00+08:00
# Purpose: Track systematic porting of 40 OCA modules from 18.0 → 19.0
# Tooling: OCA's official `oca-port` CLI + OpenUpgrade migration libraries
# Workflow: select → port → test → commit → PR
#
# REPO CORRECTIONS (2026-02-20):
#   server_environment: server-tools → server-env (OCA/server-env)
#   base_exception: server-ux → server-tools (OCA/server-tools)
#   web_environment_ribbon: server-tools → web (OCA/web, already on 19.0)
#   mail_tracking: NOT in OCA/social — see notes
#   mail_debrand: NOT in OCA/social — see notes
#
# STATUS VALUES:
#   pending: not started
#   pre_ported: already exists on OCA upstream 19.0 branch (checkout only)
#   in_progress: oca-port running
#   completed: ported, smoke-tested, committed
#   failed: oca-port failed, manual intervention needed
#   no_oca_18: not in OCA 18.0 — needs custom ipai_* module or skip
