IP Expense MVP
==============

This module provides a minimal expense tracking and approval flow for
InsightPulse on Odoo CE.

Main features
-------------

* Capture expense submissions with basic approval steps.
* Keep a lightweight footprint suitable for MVP deployments.
* Intended to be extended by other ``ip_*`` modules as needed.

Configuration
-------------

* Install the module and configure expense approvers in the standard
  Odoo settings.
* Add any additional security rules or views in downstream modules if
  required.

Notes
-----

This README is intentionally concise to satisfy OCA CI checks and will
be expanded as the expense workflow evolves.
