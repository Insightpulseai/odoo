# Plan

1) Inventory: crawl codebases, docs, configs -> normalized capability model
2) Mapping: classify each capability -> parity path candidates
3) Contracts: generate contract tests per capability
4) Evidence: run tests + collect artifacts (logs, diffs, screenshots optional)
5) CI Gates: enforce non-regression + drift detection
6) Release: publish parity dashboard + signed reports
