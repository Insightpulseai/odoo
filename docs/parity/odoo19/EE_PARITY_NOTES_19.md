## 2. Editions Matrix (Community vs Enterprise)

- Enterprise adds:
  - Unlimited functional support, version upgrades, hosting.
  - Studio, mobile apps, extra finance features (OCR, ESG, consolidations), etc.
- Community = core framework; Enterprise = Community + licensed extras.

## 3. IPAI Positioning

- "Built on **Odoo 18 Community** with **Enterprise-grade extensions**."
- "Feature parity with **Odoo Enterprise 18** for TBWA/W9 finance + ops stack."
- Not an **official Odoo Enterprise 19** installation or image.
