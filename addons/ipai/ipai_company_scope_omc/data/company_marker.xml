     Intentionally minimal: marking is done deterministically by
     scripts/company/mark_tbwa_smp_company.py which sets both:
       - res.company.ipai_is_tbwa_smp = True
       - ir.config_parameter(ipai.company.tbwa_company_id) = <company id>

     The <function> below is a convenience-only fallback for environments
     where the company happens to be named exactly "TBWA\SMP".  It logs
     a WARNING (does NOT fail install) if no such company is found.

     If your company name differs, this is a no-op — run the script manually.
