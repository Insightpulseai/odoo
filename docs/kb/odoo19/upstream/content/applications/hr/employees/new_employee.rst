New employees
=============

When a new employee is hired, the first step is to create a new employee record. This record is a
centralized place where all important information about the employee is stored, including
:ref:`general information <employees/general-info>`, :ref:`job history and skills
<employees/resume>`, :ref:`various work information <employees/work-info-tab>`, :ref:`personal
details <employees/private-info>`, :ref:`payroll-related information <employees/payroll>`, and
various :ref:`settings <employees/hr-settings>` that affect integrations with other apps in the
database.

To begin, open the :menuselection:`Employees` app, then click the :guilabel:`New` button in the
upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a blank employee form.

Proceed to fill out the required information, along with any additional details.

.. tip::
   The employee form automatically saves as data is entered. However, the form can be saved manually
   at any time by clicking the :icon:`fa-cloud-upload` :guilabel:`(Save manually)` icon.

.. _employees/skills:

Skills & certifications
-----------------------

An employee's skills and certifications can be entered in the :guilabel:`Resumé` tab in the same
manner that a resumé line is created.

To add a skill to an employee record, the skill type must first be configured. By default, Odoo
comes with two :guilabel:`Skill Types` preconfigured: *Languages* and *Soft Skills*.
:ref:`Configure the rest of the skill types <employees/skill-types>` before adding any skills to the
employee record.

When adding the first skill to an employee record, a :guilabel:`Pick a skill from the list` button
appears in the :guilabel:`Skills` section of the :guilabel:`Resumé` tab. Click the :guilabel:`Pick a
skill from the list` button, and a blank *Update Skills* pop-up window loads. Configure the
following information for each skill:

- :guilabel:`Category`: Select a :ref:`skill type <employees/skill-types>` by clicking it.
- :guilabel:`Skill`: After selecting the :guilabel:`Category`, all corresponding skills associated
  with that selected :guilabel:`Category` appear in individual buttons. For example, selecting
  :guilabel:`Language` as the :guilabel:`Skill Type` presents a variety of languages to select from
  in the :guilabel:`Skills` section. Click the appropriate preconfigured skill from the list.

  .. important::
     If the desired skill does not appear in the list, it is **not** possible to add the new skill
     from this window. New skills must be added from the :ref:`Skill Types <employees/skill-types>`
     dashboard.

- :guilabel:`Skill Level`: Pre-defined skill levels associated with the selected
  :guilabel:`Category` appear. Click on a :guilabel:`Skill Level` to select it. Skill levels can be
  created and modified from the :ref:`Skill Types <employees/skill-types>` dashboard.

Click the :guilabel:`Save & Close` button if there is only one skill to add, or click the
:guilabel:`Save & New` button to save the current entry and immediately add another skill.

At any point, a new line can be added by clicking the :guilabel:`ADD` button.

.. image:: new_employee/skills.png

.. _employees/skill-types:

Skill types
~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a skill to an employee's form, the :guilabel:`Skill Types` must be configured. Navigate to
:menuselection:`Employees app --> Configuration --> Skill Types` to view the currently configured
skill types and create new skill types.

.. note::
   The default skill of :guilabel:`Languages` is preconfigured with twenty-one skills, and the
   default :guilabel:`Soft Skills` is preconfigured with fifteen skills.

Click the :guilabel:`New` button in the upper-left corner, and a new :guilabel:`Skill Type` form

  more specific skills and should be generic.

- :guilabel:`Certification`: Click the toggle to indicate the skill is a certification. The toggle
  turns green, indicating it is active and the skill can be added to the :ref:`certifications
  <employees/certifications>` tab.
- :guilabel:`Skills`: Click :guilabel:`Add a line` and enter the :guilabel:`Name` for the new skill,
  then repeat for all other needed skills.
- :guilabel:`Levels`: Click :guilabel:`Add a line`, and enter a :guilabel:`Name` and
  :guilabel:`Progress` percentage (`0`-`100`) for each level.

  Set a :guilabel:`Default Level` by clicking the toggle on the desired line (only one level can be
  selected). The toggle turns green to indicate the default level. Typically, the lowest level is
  chosen, but any level can be selected.

  .. example::
     To add math skills in yellow, enter `Math` in the :guilabel:`Skill Type` field, and click the
     colored circle next to :guilabel:`Color`, and select yellow. Then, in the :guilabel:`Skills`
     field, enter `Algebra`, `Calculus`, and `Trigonometry`. Next, in the :guilabel:`Levels` field,
     enter `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, and `Expert`, with the :guilabel:`Progress` listed as `25`,

.. _employees/certifications:

Certifications tab

This tab houses all the employee's certifications, which can be important for employees who are
required to hold specific certifications to perform their job, such as a :abbr:`CPA (Certified
Public Accountant)` certification for accountants, or a :abbr:`CSM (Certified Safety Manager)`
certification for a construction manager.

The tab lists each :guilabel:`Certification` in a line, and displays the validity period in the
:guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`To` fields.

.. note::
   This tab **only** appears if at least one :ref:`skill type <employees/skill-types>` is configured
   as *certification*. When adding certifications, **only** skill types marked as a certification

.. _employees/private-info:

Personal tab
============

No information in the :guilabel:`Personal` tab is required to create an employee, however, some
information in this section may be necessary for the company's payroll department.

In order to properly process payslips and ensure all deductions are accounted for, it is recommended
to check with the accounting department and payroll department to ensure all required fields are
populated. For example, to pay employees with direct deposit, they **must** have a trusted account
listed in the :guilabel:`Bank Accounts` field.

Enter the various information in the following sections and fields of the :guilabel:`Personal` tab.
Fields are entered either using a drop-down menu, ticking a checkbox, or typing in the information.

 .. note::
    Depending on the localization setting, other fields may be present. For example, for the United
    States localization, a :guilabel:`SSN No` (Social Security Number) field is present.

.. _employees/private-contact:

Private contact
---------------

- :guilabel:`Email`: Enter the employee's personal email address.
- :guilabel:`Phone`: Enter the employee's personal phone number.

Add a bank account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an employee is added to the database, their bank account must also be added. To add a new bank
account, type the account number into the :guilabel:`Bank Accounts` field in the *Personal* tab of
the employee form, then click :guilabel:`Create and edit..`.

A *Create Bank Accounts* pop-up window loads with the bank account number populating the
:guilabel:`Account Number` field. Next, enter the :guilabel:`Clearing Number` (also referred to as a
*routing number*) in the corresponding field.

The employee's name populates the :guilabel:`Account Holder` and :guilabel:`Account Holder Name`
fields by default, but can be updated if needed.

Next, select the :guilabel:`Bank` using the drop-down menu. If the bank is not already configured,
click :guilabel:`Create and edit...` and a blank *Create Bank* pop-up window loads, with the bank
name populating the :guilabel:`Name` field. Next, enter the :guilabel:`Bank Identifier Code`, also
referred to as a BIC or SWIFT code. If applicable, select the :guilabel:`Intermediary Bank` using
the drop-down menu. This bank acts as a facilitator between banks for international wire transfers,
when needed. Enter the :guilabel:`Bank Address`, :guilabel:`Phone`, and :guilabel:`Email` in the
corresponding fields. Once the form is complete, click :guilabel:`Save`, and the new bank populates
the :guilabel:`Bank` field.

Click the :guilabel:`Send Money` toggle. This changes the toggle color to green, and the status
changes from :guilabel:`Untrusted` in gray text, to :guilabel:`Trusted` in green text.

The :guilabel:`Employee` field is populated with the employee's name, and cannot be modified.

Finally, add any relevant notes in the :guilabel:`Note` tab.

   :alt: The Create Bank Account form with all the information filled out.

.. important::
   To ensure payments are processed and sent to the bank account, mark the bank account as
   :guilabel:`Trusted`. Having an :guilabel:`Untrusted` bank account for an employee causes an error

   configured.

     **cannot** have working hours that are outside of a company's working schedule.

     Each individual working schedule is company-specific. For multi-company databases, each company
