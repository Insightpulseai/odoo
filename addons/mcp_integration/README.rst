MCP Integration
===============

This module provides integration points between Odoo CE and external
MCP tools.

Main features
-------------

* Manage MCP server definitions and credentials.
* Trigger MCP operations from Odoo records.
* Prepare the groundwork for richer external tool orchestration.

Configuration
-------------

* Install the module and configure MCP server details.
* Define any access rules or automation for invoking MCP operations.

Roadmap
-------

This README is intentionally minimal to satisfy OCA CI checks and will be
expanded as MCP integrations deepen.
