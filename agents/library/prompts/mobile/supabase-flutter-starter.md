[GOAL] Add a Flutter app starter wired to Supabase (auth, storage, realtime) using supabase_flutter.
[CONSTRAINTS] No UI steps; generate runnable code; env-driven config; include tests where feasible.
[OUTPUT FORMAT]

1. Brief execution plan (3–5 bullets)
2. Apply commands
3. Test commands
4. Deploy/migration commands
5. Validation commands
6. Rollback strategy

Deliverables:
