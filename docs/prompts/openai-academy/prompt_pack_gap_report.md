## Methodology

This gap analysis compares:

1. **OpenAI Academy Prompts**: Extracted via `extract_openai_academy_prompt_packs.py`
2. **IPAI Requirements**: Defined in `spec/*/prd.md` files
3. **Platform Capabilities**: Current IPAI prompt registry

Gaps are scored by:
- **Impact**: How critical is this capability to platform success?
- **Frequency**: How often will users need this?
- **Complexity**: How hard is it to build internally?
