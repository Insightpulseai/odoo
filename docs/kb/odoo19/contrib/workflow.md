# Development Workflow: PRs, Git

## What it is

The standard process for contributing code to Odoo or managing custom projects.

## Key concepts

- **Branches:** Feature branches.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Code review mechanism.
- **Runbot:** Odoo's CI that automatically tests PRs.

## Patterns

1. Fork repository.
2. Create branch `19.0-fix-issue-xyz`.
3. Commit changes (atomic commits).
4. Push and open PR.
5. Check Runbot/CI status.
