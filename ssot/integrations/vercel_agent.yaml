    description: >
      Multi-step reasoning over PR diff; generates patches; runs real builds/tests/linters
      in secure sandboxes; only suggestions that pass sandbox checks appear in the PR.
    activation: "PR open/push (auto) or @vercel comment (on-demand)"
    output: "Inline PR comment with sandbox-validated suggestions (one-click apply)"
  on_demand_commands:
    examples:
      - "@vercel run a review"
      - "@vercel fix the type errors"
      - "@vercel why is this failing?"

policy:
  guidelines_required: true
  # The guideline_file above is read by Vercel Agent to enforce repo conventions.
  # Highest-signal rules (boundaries, atomicity, SSOT) must appear in that file.
  no_ui_only_steps: true
  # Agent must not produce suggestions that require UI-only actions.
  ssot_immutable: true
  # Agent suggestions MUST NOT modify files in ssot/; only humans or CI may update SSOT.
  secrets_policy: vault_refs_only
  # Any suggested code must use env var references, not inline secrets.
  pr_atomicity: one_logical_unit_per_pr
  # Agent should flag PRs that mix unrelated logical units (cross-branch contamination signal).

boundary_rules:
  - "Vercel Agent is advisory only — never treated as authoritative SSOT."
  - "Agent suggestions must be converted to ops.advisor_findings or workbook steps before acting."
  - "Agent cannot write to any SSOT files; only humans or CI can update SSOT."
  - "Agent suggestions that fail the real sandbox build/test are suppressed by Vercel — never apply suppressed suggestions manually."
  - "Log '@vercel suggested X' into ops.run_events for audit trail when acting on suggestions."
  - "PR atomicity: flag any PR that contains files from more than one logical domain (e.g. migrations + Edge Functions in same PR)."

required_secrets: []
# No secrets required — Agent authenticates via Vercel's GitHub App installation.

notes: |
  Treat Vercel Agent as a "reviewer signal," not an execution engine.
  When @vercel produces suggestions in a PR:
    - Apply via Vercel dashboard one-click (sandbox-validated) or manually after review.
    - Store notable patterns as ops.advisor_findings (pillar: ops_excellence, severity: info).
    - Link to relevant workbook step for tracking.
  Merge order safety: Vercel Agent reviews each PR independently; it does not know
  about cross-PR FK dependencies. Enforce merge order manually (PR #429 → C → A/B).
