# Integration Layer

**Purpose**: Connect systems, automate workflows, and enable cross-layer communication

**Layer Position**: Layer 7 of 7 (Strategy → Portfolio → Process → Execution → Control → Evidence → **Integration**)

---

## Purpose & Scope

This layer provides **bridges and orchestration** across:

- **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol servers for AI-native automation
- **Agents**: AI agents that coordinate complex workflows
- **Supabase**: Database, Edge Functions, and real-time sync
- **External Systems**: APIs, webhooks, and third-party integrations

## Success Metrics

Integration layer effectiveness measured by:

1. **Automation Rate**: % of manual workflows automated (Target: 70%)
2. **Integration Uptime**: % of time integrations operational (Target: 99.5%)
3. **Error Rate**: Failed integration attempts (Target: <1%)
4. **Latency**: Average integration response time (Target: <500ms)
