# Curated Documents Manifest
# ===========================
# Documents selectively imported from operational repos into ipai-learn.
# Each entry must include: source, reason, owner, last_sync.
#
# Rules:
# - Prefer deep links over copying
# - Only executive-facing, stable content qualifies
# - Bulk imports are prohibited (see CURATION_POLICY.md)

version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2026-01-26"

# Eligible documents for curation (3-10 max recommended)
items:
  # Example entry (uncomment and modify when adding curated docs):
  # - name: "Architecture Overview"
  #   source: "odoo-ce/docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md"
  #   target: "docs-site/docs/architecture/overview.md"
  #   reason: "High-level architecture suitable for enterprise stakeholders"
  #   owner: "docs-team"
  #   last_sync: "2026-01-26"
  #   status: "pending"  # pending | approved | synced

# Currently no documents are curated.
# Add entries above following the example format.

# Exclusion list - explicitly excluded from curation
exclusions:
  - pattern: "docs/evidence/**"
    reason: "CI/CD evidence files are repo-specific"
  - pattern: "docs/data-model/**"
    reason: "Technical schema docs not suitable for enterprise audience"
  - pattern: "spec/**"
    reason: "Spec kits are developer-focused"
  - pattern: "**/*_internal.md"
    reason: "Internal docs not for external curation"
