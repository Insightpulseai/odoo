Verification Checklist - Supabase SSOT + Odoo SOR Implementation

✅ Constitution clearly defines SSOT vs SOR and lists what must remain in Odoo
  - Odoo SOR list includes: accounting truth, ERP operational truth, legal/audit artifacts
  - Supabase SSOT list includes: ops/control plane, identity/access, integration state, MDM overlays, analytics/AI
  - Ownership/conflict policy is explicit (Odoo wins for Odoo-owned domains)
  - Hard "Don'ts" include "no shadow ledger" and "no unauthorized writebacks"
  - Location: spec/odoo-ee-parity-seed/constitution.md:85-136 (pre-existing, no changes)

✅ PRD includes a Supabase feature mapping table with explicit boundary constraints
  - Table maps all major Supabase capabilities (Database, RLS+Auth, RPC, Edge Functions, Realtime, Storage, Queues, Cron, Observability, Vectors)
  - Each row has SSOT usage description and SOR boundary constraint
  - Acceptance criteria require ownership declaration for new integrations
  - Location: spec/odoo-ee-parity-seed/spec.md:157-176

✅ Plan mentions CI enforcement hooks
  - CI check for shadow ledger detection mentioned
  - Ownership declaration requirement documented
  - Audit trail requirements for Edge Functions specified
  - Location: spec/odoo-ee-parity-seed/plan.md:111-114

✅ Pattern docs enforce SSOT/SOR boundary
  - Each pattern doc has "SSOT/SOR Boundary Notes" section
  - Pattern docs reference upstream examples via raw URLs
  - Patterns are extraction-focused, not full app clones
  - Location: docs/supabase/patterns/*.md (5 files created)

✅ Partner integrations policy is enforceable
  - Policy states "Supabase primitives first" rule
  - RLS perimeter requirement is explicit
  - Audit trail requirements are documented
  - Secrets handling is specified
  - Location: spec/odoo-ee-parity-seed/constitution.md:115-127

✅ UI components policy prevents design system duplication
  - Policy allows UI for SSOT-facing apps only
  - Policy prohibits shadow-ledger UIs
  - Policy notes deprecated supabase/ui library
  - Location: spec/odoo-ee-parity-seed/constitution.md:129-135

✅ No unrelated governance sections were rewritten
  - Existing ipai_* namespace policy remains intact (lines 67-82)
  - Existing parity boundary rules remain intact (Article 4: lines 238-327)
  - Changes are surgical additions, not rewrites
