OCA EE Parity Installation Plan - Summary
================================================================
Timestamp: 2026-02-20T13:35:00+08:00

CURRENT STATE:
  - Base allowlist: 70 modules
  - Successfully installed: 30 modules (42.9%)
  - Blocked (missing in 19.0): 32 modules
  - Blocked (uninstallable): 8 modules
  - Current EE parity: ~70% (baseline features)

ENHANCEMENT:
  - Enhanced allowlist: 120+ modules (+50 high-value additions)
  - New modules focus: invoicing, purchase, contacts, auth
  - Expected install after Phase 1: 60-80 modules
  - Target EE parity: 85%+

NEW MODULES BY CATEGORY:
  Accounting/Invoicing: 10 modules (recurring billing, discounts, validation)
  Purchase Extended: 10 modules (blanket orders, deposits, framework agreements)
  Partner/Contact: 9 modules (hierarchy, ID tracking, ranking)
  Server Auth: 3 modules (session timeout, impersonation)
  Accounting Tools: 3 modules (tag codes, print, post dates)

INSTALLATION PHASES:
  Phase 1 (Immediate): Install 50+ available modules from enhanced allowlist
  Phase 2 (2-4 weeks): Port 15 P0 foundation modules from 18.0
  Phase 3 (4-6 weeks): Port 16 P1 high-value modules from 18.0

CRITICAL GAPS (Needs Porting):
  - Bank reconciliation (5 modules) - BLOCKER for finance ops
  - Connector framework (5 modules) - BLOCKER for integrations
  - Server environment (2 modules) - BLOCKER for production deploy
  - Purchase approvals (4 modules) - High value workflow

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
  Phase 1: 70% → 82% EE parity (+30-50 modules)
  Phase 2: 82% → 85% EE parity (foundation working)
  Phase 3: 85% → 90% EE parity (full finance + procurement)

NEXT ACTIONS:
  1. Review enhanced allowlist
  2. Backup current config
  3. Run installation with enhanced allowlist
  4. Start porting critical P0 modules
