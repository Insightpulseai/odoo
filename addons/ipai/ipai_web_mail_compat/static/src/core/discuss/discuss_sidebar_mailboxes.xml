     Replaces: mail_tracking/static/src/core/discuss/discuss_sidebar_mailboxes.xml
     Reason  : OCA template inherits from mail.Discuss.mobileTopbar which was
               renamed to mail.DiscussContent.mobileTopbar in Odoo 19.

     Odoo 19 compat notes:
       - Mailbox.main removed: //span[@t-esc='mailbox.counter'] no longer exists.
       - DiscussSidebarMailboxes removed: <Mailbox mailbox="store.failed" /> triggers
         ctx.mailbox.notEq() crash because store.failed is a plain JS object, not a
         Record. The Mailbox component requires a Record instance with notEq().
       - mobileTopbar removed for same reason: t-call="mail.MobileMailbox" passes
         store.failed which has no notEq().
     All three extensions are disabled until store.failed is ported to a proper
     Record or OCA releases an Odoo 19 compatible mail_tracking.
