# OCA Module Porting Queue for Odoo 19.0
# Auto-generated timestamp: 2026-02-20T18:00:00+08:00
# Last updated: 2026-02-20T23:30:00+08:00 by Teammate 2 (connector porter)
# Purpose: Track systematic porting of 40 OCA modules from 18.0 → 19.0
# Tooling: OCA's official `oca-port` CLI + OpenUpgrade migration libraries
# Workflow: select → port → test → commit → PR
#
# REPO CORRECTIONS (2026-02-20):
#   server_environment: server-tools → server-env (OCA/server-env)
#   base_exception: server-ux → server-tools (OCA/server-tools)
#   web_environment_ribbon: server-tools → web (OCA/web, already on 19.0)
#   mail_tracking: CORRECTED social → mail (OCA/mail — confirmed exists on 18.0)
#   mail_debrand: CORRECTED social → mail (OCA/mail — confirmed exists on 18.0)
#   NOTE: OCA/mail 19.0 does NOT have mail_tracking or mail_debrand yet (5 modules only)
#         Both require oca-port from OCA/mail 18.0 → 19.0
#
# STATUS VALUES:
#   pending: not started
#   pre_ported: already exists on OCA upstream 19.0 branch (checkout only)
#   in_progress: oca-port running
#   completed: ported, smoke-tested, committed
#   failed: oca-port failed, manual intervention needed
#   no_oca_18: not in OCA 18.0 — needs custom ipai_* module or skip

      CONFIRMED: base_tier_validation NOT present on server-ux/19.0 working tree.
      server-ux has oca/18.0 (283136fd) and oca/19.0 (9ac70e43) remote refs available.
      OPERATOR must run:

        git fetch oca 18.0 19.0

        git add base_tier_validation/

      T08 INVESTIGATION COMPLETE — repo correction made.
      FINDING: mail_tracking is in OCA/mail (NOT OCA/social as previously recorded).
      OCA/mail 18.0: mail_tracking CONFIRMED (version ~18.0.1.0.8, 43 modules total).
      OCA/mail 19.0: mail_tracking NOT present (only 5 modules ported so far).
      ACTION REQUIRED — operator must:
        1. Clone OCA/mail if not already present:
           git clone https://github.com/OCA/mail.git /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/Insightpulseai/odoo/addons/oca/mail
        2. Set up remote:
           cd addons/oca/mail && git remote rename origin oca
        3. Run oca-port:
           git fetch oca 18.0 19.0
           oca-port oca/18.0 oca/19.0 mail_tracking --non-interactive --repo-name mail 2>&1 | tee /tmp/port_mail_tracking.log
        4. Verify and commit.

    notes: |
      T08 INVESTIGATION COMPLETE — repo correction made.
      FINDING: mail_debrand is in OCA/mail (NOT OCA/social as previously recorded).
      OCA/mail 18.0: mail_debrand CONFIRMED (version ~18.0.1.0.1).
      OCA/mail 19.0: mail_debrand NOT present (only 5 modules ported so far).
      STATUS CORRECTED: was no_oca_18 (wrong repo), now pending with correct oca_repo: mail.
      ACTION REQUIRED — same OCA/mail clone setup as mail_tracking (above), then:
        oca-port oca/18.0 oca/19.0 mail_debrand --non-interactive --repo-name mail 2>&1 | tee /tmp/port_mail_debrand.log
      NOTE: mail_debrand was previously tracked as dead/retired — it is ALIVE in OCA/mail.
